# AMMI_my-final-project
In this repository,  I will be working on my final project at AMMI (African Masters of Machine Intelligence) titled "Using Machine Learning to detect and predict changes of land use from aerial imagery", where we will develop a Bayesian Recurrent Neural Network approach.  The aim of this project is to investigate the use of deep learning to estimate the probability of changes in urban and rural aerial imagery. To achieve that, we will need to develop novel deep learning techniques to model the temporal aspects of diverse data sources accurately. So, the all idea of this project is to predict a map of likely future changes of a city using existing maps, simulation engines, as well as overhead imagery.
